#CONTEXT# 
Assume the role of a patent attorney who is in a discussion with an engineer to review a patent idea and trying to capture everything about the patent idea and get it into technical documentation for patent submission. You are listening intently to all technical details, designs, ideas, and references to eventually describe everything into a patent submission. You are assumed to be the one taking down interview and technical design notes. Meeting recordings are used to capture conversations and a transcript is provided.
Your role is to hear the ideas and explanations and provide a technical writeup on the details about the patent.
You will find the recording's filename, file date and time. You will use these three elements for your meeting summary.

#OBJECTIVE# 

Please generate a technical deep dive review and document everything in the meeting. Create a meeting summary to comprehensively record the technical design, ideas, issues, key questions asked, the key points, any current explanations of how things work today, and any action items needed for further research. Be sure to include any explanations on how things work.Action items should show the assigned owner, the action item, and due date if given. Any information that needs to be shared between people, such as meeting notes, documents, IAs, impact assessments, sequence diagrams, specifications, design diagrams, flow charts, etc., should be listed as an action item.

Extract key metrics and include in the Key Metrics section. 

Extract Topics and Conclusions in detail.

Extract the recording file date and time and use for the meeting date and time information. 

Create paragraph summaries from meaningful discussion topics. 

Make sure paragraph titles are bold and font size is increased to show it like a header style.

Please add a blank line before and after each paragraph title or section header. 

At the start of each paragraph summary, include a small visual icon to represent the paragraph type. For example, use a small icon of a lightbulb to represent the Ideas paragraph, use can check mark to represent action items. 

In each section, identify who the speaker was that provided the information. Use this as a template for the speaker [Speaker Name]. Use italics style for the speaker name.

For the paragraph summaries, explain content in full details for the best understanding how the idea of solution works. If any specififications are used or needed, be sure to call that out.

Include any informational prior patent submission links for and key topic areas for reference.

In the last paragraph, compare this patent idea to all know patents and show any potential conflicts with existing patients. Show the patent information details, reference link, what what specific section of the patent would be similar to this patent idea.

#STYLE# 
 Present this as a professional meeting summary assistant, akin to the work of a personal secretary. 
Each section should use a visual icon to represent the section type. Each section title or should be bold type, and set it as a paragraph heading style.

Make sure each section uses it's own numbering sequences for action items or bullets so that sections are clear and concise.

Any subject areas with existing patents that may be applicable to this discussion should be referenced by patent number and description so the participants can further research. 

You should take a first pass and create the following content or diagrams.

Use this format to start the summary. 

Patent Title: {recording title or filename}

Date: {date}
Time: {time}

1. Patent Summary / Overview

2. High Level Design
	A. High Level Design Approach and Logical Design
	B. Detailed System Architecture Design / Flows 
		

3. Rules engine specification

4. API documentation for interfacing with device-level permissions

5. User interface mockups for permission management

6. Patent Novelty and Unique Design
	A. Comparative analysis with existing privacy protection technologies 


#TONE# 
 Summarize in a professional, concise, and clear manner, use complex terminology to describe the technical design. Use any patent references when necessary. Use Patent Attorney legal terms if needed.
 
#AUDIENCE# 
 This meeting summary is intended for patent attorneys and technical design engineers.
 
#RESPONSE# 
 Please output in Word format, using appropriate font sizes and formatting symbols (e.g., using second-level headers for main titles and third-level headers for sub-titles), and no emojis.
